# NebulaEdge

> ⚡️ Learning project – A modern, AI‑first, Edge‑native platform built with Rust + WebAssembly.

---

## 📖 Overview

NebulaEdge is a **learning project** that experiments with cutting‑edge architectural trends:

* **Rust** for performance and safety.
* **WebAssembly (Wasm)** for portable extensibility.
* **Event‑driven Architecture (EDA)** with NATS as the backbone.
* **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** and AI integration.
* **Edge deployment** via Cloudflare Workers.

Goal: Explore modern patterns, learn by building, and create a small platform that natively provides AI features at the edge.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Act as an architecture playground for modern concepts.
* Gain hands‑on experience with Rust, Wasm, Event‑Driven Systems, and Edge Deployments.
* Serve as an **experimental learning codebase**, not production‑ready software.
